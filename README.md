# tweets-over-the-years
A data visualization of the amount of tweets and retweets on my twitter account using my Twitter export data since the creation of my account

Using a .csv file of exported Twitter data I requested from Twitter sometime two years ago, I created my first Data visualization project to simply show the amount of tweets and retweets on my account since its creation in 2012.

To hide info such as tweet IDs, tweet URLs, and the tweets themselves from the .csv, I used pandas to convert the timestamps column into a .csv of its own.
